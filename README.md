## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!

I started my Data Analytics career by teaching myself SQL and Tableau online. I have taken multiple courses and have gained years of experience through consistency and hard work. I further my learning and understanding of Data and SQL by picking up projects from online services and by providing Data Analytics services to colleagues and friends that have their own businesses.

This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.
